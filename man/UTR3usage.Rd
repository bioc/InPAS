\arguments{
\item{CPsites}{outputs of [CPsites()]}

\item{coverage}{coverage for each sample, outputs of [coverageFromBedGraph()]}

\item{hugeData}{is this dataset consume too much memory? 
if it is TRUE, the coverage will be saved into tempfiles.}

\item{BPPARAM}{an optional [BiocParallel::BiocParallelParam-class]
instance determining the parallel back-end to be used during 
evaluation, or a list of BiocParallelParam instances, to be 
applied in sequence for nested calls to bplapply.}

analysis? By default, FALSE}
