\title{Calculate weights for GC composition}
\usage{
gcComp(genome, seqnames, window = 50, BPPARAM = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{genome}{An object of \link[BSgenome:BSgenome-class]{BSgenome::BSgenome}}

\item{seqnames}{a character(n) vector, the chromosome/scaffolds' names
in the same forms of seqnames in the BSgenome}

\item{window}{size of a sliding window, which optimally is set to the read
length}

\item{BPPARAM}{an optional \link[BiocParallel:BiocParallelParam-class]{BiocParallel::BiocParallelParam} instance
determining the parallel back-end to be used during evaluation, or a list
of BiocParallelParam instances, to be applied in sequence for nested calls
to bplapply. It can be set to NULL or bpparam()}
}
\value{
A list of numeric vectors containing the weight (scaffold-level GC\\%
/ GC\\% per sliding window) for GC composition-based correction for each
chromosome/scaffold.
}
\description{
Calculate read weights for GC composition-based coverage correction

library(BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10)
genome <- BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10
