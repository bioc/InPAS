\title{Calculate weights for GC composition}
\usage{
gcComp(genome, seqnames, window = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{genome}{An object of [BSgenome::BSgenome-class]}

\item{seqnames}{chromosome/scaffold names in the same forms of seqnames in the genome}

\item{window}{size of a sliding window, which optimally is set to the read length}
}
\value{
A list of numeric vectors containing the weight (scaffold-level GC% / GC%
per sliding window) for GC composition-based correction (Cheung et al. 2011).
}
\description{
Calculate read weights for GC composition-based coverage correction

\examples{
library(BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10)
genome <- BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10
gcComp(genome, "chr1")
