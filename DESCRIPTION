Description: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is one of the important post-transcriptional 
             regulation mechanisms which occurs in most human genes. InPAS facilitates the
             discovery of novel APA sites and the differential usage of APA sites from RNA-Seq data. 
             It leverages cleanUpdTSeq to fine tune identified APA sites by removing false 
             sites due to internal-priming.
